- Description:

The challenge involves real estate data collection, scrapping and classifiying the data into a csv file.
The data is pulled from the following link: https://www.immoweb.be/en/search/house-and-apartment/for-sale?countries=BE


- Requirements:

Collecting 10,000 Property URLs including the details of each property
The dataset must involve belgian properties that are displayed into columns and rows
The Properties must be classified into those specific features
The final result has to be in a csv file format


- Installation:

The running has been seperated into 3 parts to avoid having the run for longer hours.
To avoid an overload of requests a timesleep range random.randit(1,3) has been applied.


- Usage:

This project includes a large enough dataset with multiple variables that can give ideas for the end user to manipulate the data even further to draw conclusions.
The fictional company "ImmoEliza" could perhaps use z score 95% confidence interval statistical measures to introduce models and make predictions of all kinds.


(Visuals)

The dataset is displayed through an excel sheet table.
